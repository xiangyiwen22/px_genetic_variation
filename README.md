### Genotyping-by-Sequencing for the Analysis of the Genetic Variation of *Podosphaera xanthii*, Incitant of Cucurbit Powdery Mildew 

We found that isolates collected in Illinois had high within-sample genetic diversity, which was shown by both clustering analysis (Fig. 1) and Simpsonâ€™s index values (Simpson 1949), but there was higher genetic similarity be- tween Illinois and other locations based on Fst calculations
